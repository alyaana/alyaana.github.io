  <p>Hello! My name is Alyaana Zaman. I'm a student at Georgia Tech studying Architecture. I am from Pakistan, but I have lived in 6 countries. Having this experience has made me more aware of problems like class disparities and environmental impact, which I hope to alleviate with my architecture.  I hope to work in sustainable and mixed-use architecture to contribute to the urban and communal fabric in a meaningful way. In my free time, I read (mostly classic novels), knit, and listen to music of all types I also love going to local bands' shows. I also foster cats!</p>
